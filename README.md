# Subsolar

Subsolar is a [Textual](https://github.com/Codeux/Textual) theme inspired heavily by [Sublime](http://sublimetext.com/) (for typography) and [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) (for color).

Because I'm on IRC all day every day, I decided it was worth investing a bit of time to try to make it look better. This is the best I can come up with so far, and I'll improve it over time.

While choosing colors, I made extensive use of the [Solarized cheat sheet](http://www.zovirl.com/2011/07/22/solarized_cheat_sheet/).

## Usage

To use, first find where your Textual themes are located. This will probably work for you:

    $ cd ~/Library/Group\ Containers/8482Q6EPL6.com.codeux.irc.textual/Library/Application\ Support/Textual/Styles/

Next, just clone this project there:

    $ git clone https://github.com/shiflett/subsolar.git

Restart Textual, then under Preferences, you should see a new style called *subsolar*.

If you have any trouble, just [let me know](http://shiflett.org/contact), and I'll try to help.
